# TO INFINITY AND BEYOND

[Live Demo](https://planetary-tourism.vercel.app)

To Infinity And Beyond is a user-friendly online platform designed to provide an immersive experience for users interested in exploring the planets of our solar system. Leveraging the power of React-three-fiber and three.js, the website offers a visually stunning and interactive environment.

## Key Features:

1. Planetary Selection: The main page showcases all eight planets of our solar system suspended in space. Users can intuitively click on any planet to initiate a closer exploration.

2. Interactive 3D Visualization: The website employs React-three-fiber and three.js to render a high-fidelity 3D representation of the selected planet. This allows users to interactively manipulate the view, zooming in and out for a detailed examination.

3. Planetary Itinerary: The website offers a guided tour itinerary, allowing users to embark on a virtual journey to visit all eight planets in the solar system. This feature provides a structured and educational experience, guiding users through each celestial body.

4. Focus Mode: Upon clicking on a planet, it comes into sharp focus, dominating the screen. This ensures a comprehensive examination of the planet's surface, features, and surrounding environment.

5. Informative Sidebar: Alongside the focused planet, a dynamically updated sidebar provides detailed information about the selected celestial body. This includes facts, statistics, and other relevant data, enhancing the educational aspect of the experience.

6. Multi-Platform Compatibility: The website is designed to be accessible across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience for users on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (coming soon).

7. To-Scale Representation: All planets are rendered to their actual scale, providing users with an accurate sense of the relative sizes and distances within our solar system.

## Development Stack:

- React-three-fiber: A powerful library for creating 3D content in React applications.

- three.js: A popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics, used in conjunction with
  React-three-fiber for rendering planetary environments.

- React: A widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- HTML/CSS: Standard technologies for structuring and styling the web pages.

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building production-ready web applications. It enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features that enhance performance.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization. It's particularly efficient for building modern, responsive web applications.

## Future Enhancements:

- Augmented Reality (AR) Integration: The project may expand to incorporate AR features, allowing users to experience planets in their real-world environment through their devices' cameras.

- User Authentication and Customization: Implementing user accounts would enable features like saving favourite planets, tracking progress, and personalising the experience.

- Social Integration: Users might be given the option to share their experiences on social media platforms, fostering community engagement and outreach.

The Space Tourism Website stands at the forefront of interactive educational platforms, providing a captivating journey through our solar system for users of all ages and levels of astronomical interest.
